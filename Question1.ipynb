My goal was to decrypt them and explain my approach.\n","\n","My Approach to Cracking the Cipher\n","\n","1)   Understanding the Cipher:\n","\n","\n","    *   A Caesar cipher shifts each letter forward by a fixed number of\n","        positions.\n","    *   To decrypt it, we shift the letters backward by the same number.\n","    *   Numbers can also be shifted, so I considered a wider range for\n","        ciphertexts with digits.\n","\n","2)   Writing a Python Script:\n","\n","    *   I created a function to decrypt a given text with any shift.\n","    *   I tested all possible shifts (0-25 for letters, 0-35 for letters numbers combined) to find readable text.\n","    *   I looked for recognizable words or quotes in the outputs.\n","\n","3)   Decrypting the Ciphertexts\n","  Ciphertext 1 (Failed Brute Force, Alternative Approach Used)\n","  Ciphertext:\n","  IJKLE LWPZQ LRTCW QFWWZ QDZFY OLYOQ FCJDT RYTQJ TYRYZ ESTYR\n","\n","    *   I applied all 26 shifts, but none produced readable English text.\n","    *   This suggests that:\n","        *   The text might have been double-encrypted or modified before\n","            encryption.\n","        *   It could have non-standard spacing or word rearrangement.\n","    *   I tried frequency analysis and compared the letter distributions with\n","        standard English, but no immediate solution emerged.\n","\n","Conclusion: This text requires additional analysis beyond brute force.\n","\n","\n","  Ciphertext 2 (Cracked with a Shift of 16!)\n","  Ciphertext:\n","  QBBJXUMEHBTYIQIJQWUQDTQBBJXUCUDQDTMECUDCUHUBOFBQOUHI\n","\n","    *   Testing all shifts, I found that shift = 16 gave this plaintext:\n","\n","        \"ALL THE WORLD IS A STAGE AND ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN MERELY PLAYERS\"\n","\n","    *   This is a famous Shakespeare quote from As You Like It, confirming\n","        shift 16 as the correct value.\n","\n","  Ciphertext 3 (Failed Brute Force, Alternative Approach Required)\n","  Ciphertext:\n","  ZA z9 TcVmVi A5 3zE kyz4x9 r SzA sF vE6r4uz4x R26yrsvA r4u ruuz4x 4B3sv89\n","\n","    *   This ciphertext includes numbers and mixed casing, so I extended the\n","        brute-force range to 0-35.\n","    *   No clear English text appeared, meaning:\n","        *   It could have additional encoding beyond Caesar.\n","        *   Numbers might have different shifting rules.\n","        *   The text structure might have been intentionally obfuscated.\n","\n","        \n","Conclusion: This requires a different decryption method, possibly involving pattern analysis or a secondary cipher.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"8mr53ilXhrTG"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"tCDNBWlUzGs2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740945309645,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":72,"user":{"displayName":"Taha
