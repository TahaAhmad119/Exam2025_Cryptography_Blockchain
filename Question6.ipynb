Overview**\n","PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) keys can be generated using different cryptographic algorithms. Two common options are **RSA 3072-bit** and **Ed25519**. This document provides a comparison of their characteristics and explains how to visually distinguish them.\n","\n","---\n","### **2. Key Characteristics**\n","| Feature          | RSA 3072  | ED25519  |\n","|-----------------|-----------|-----------|\n","| **Key Length**  | 3072 bits | 256 bits |\n","| **Security Level** | ~128-bit equivalent | 128-bit equivalent |\n","| **Performance** | Slower (especially in signing) | Faster (both signing & verification) |\n","| **Key Size** | Larger | Smaller |\n","| **Quantum Resistance** | Not quantum-safe | Not quantum-safe but harder to attack |\n","| **Compatibility** | Widely supported | Modern, but some legacy systems may lack support |\n","| **Use Case** | Good for long-term PGP compatibility | Best for modern, high-performance cryptography |\n","\n","---\n","### **3. How to Visually Distinguish RSA 3072 vs. ED25519 Keys**\n","You can differentiate these keys by examining their structure and size. Here are some key points:\n","\n","#### **A. Key Block Length and Size**\n","- **RSA 3072**: Much **longer key block**, spanning multiple lines due to its large key size (3072 bits).\n","- **ED25519**: **Shorter key block**, since Ed25519 uses a compact 256-bit key.\n","\n","#### **B. Key Algorithm in the Public Key Block**\n","Inside the ASCII-armored key, you can check the algorithm type:\n","- **RSA 3072**: Contains **\"algo 1\"** (RSA).\n","- **ED25519**: Contains **\"algo 22\"** (EdDSA with Ed25519).\n","\n","#### **C. Fingerprint Format**\n","- **RSA 3072**: Fingerprint is derived from a larger modulus and is often **longer**.\n","- **ED25519**: Fingerprint is **shorter** due to the smaller key size.\n","\n","#### **D. Command Line Check**\n","If you have a key and want to confirm its type, you can use the following command:\n","```sh\n","gpg --list-keys --with-keygrip\n","```\n","This will display key details, including the **algorithm** used.\n","\n","#### **E. Manual Inspection via Base64 Content**\n","If you decode the base64 content inside the key block:\n","- **RSA 3072**: Contains **large numerical values** for the modulus and exponent.\n","- **ED25519**: Shorter encoded key structure, appearing more compact.\n","\n","---\n","### **4. Summary**\n","- **RSA 3072 keys** are much larger, widely supported, but slower.\n","- **ED25519 keys** are smaller, faster, and modern but may lack legacy support.\n","- You can distinguish them by checking **key length, algorithm type, fingerprint size, or running a command-line check**.\n","\n","Would you like a step-by-step guide on verifying a specific key?\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"5UPCP-f3B1ye"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"hhDlci1ZByjO"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}]}
